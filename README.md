# C Language
Styding C language

Hi, This is all about C. :raising_hand:

Why C?

C and C++ are among the most powerful languages you can find. Those are quite fast and stable, and thus are a good choice for microcontrollers. The compiler used to transform code into object files is avr-g++. Then, a program called avrdude is used to upload the program into the Arduino microcontroller.

The C programming language is one of the most powerful and efficient programming languages in the world. If you’re interested in learning programming or building applications, learning C should be the first step you take. Most of the modern-day programming languages have been inspired by it to some degree. C was developed back in the 1970s by Dennis M. Ritchie for a UNIX system. It is based on languages like B, CPL and BCPL. Unlike its predecessors, C is capable of both high level programming as well as low-level programming. C also does not take up much computer resources, so it can be used by small applications as well as large programs (like operating systems). (from https://blog.udemy.com/)

During my Computer Engineering Degrees I will make this repo as I learn more and more each day...
I thought I'd document what worked for me.
This is just for hobbyist fun. I did not expect anything more at a price of less than a cup of coffee :coffee:.

The most important audience for your code is yourself, 
six month after writing it (ie after you forgotten 
everything but needs to fix something)

```

I´m using [Visual C++ 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

I will also use [Dev-C++ download | SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/) This is an amazing IDE! Try it yourself!

The solution will be numereded and divided into important computer subject:
Be Welcome to my website, where I explore Arduino, PIC & Rpi - [Jungletronics & KidTronics](https://medium.com/@J.3). 
I'm J3, The Arduino Hobbyist! and I will be your host :blush:    
Welcome!!!
