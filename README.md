# C Language
Styding C language

Hi, This is all about C. :raising_hand:

Why C?

C and C++ are among the most powerful languages you can find. Those are quite fast and stable, and thus are a good choice for microcontrollers. The compiler used to transform code into object files is avr-g++. Then, a program called avrdude is used to upload the program into the Arduino microcontroller.

During my Computer Engineering Degrees I will make this repo as I learn more and more each day...
I thought I'd document what worked for me.
This is just for hobbyist fun. I did not expect anything more at a price of less than a cup of coffee :coffee:.

```
The most important audience for your code is yourself, 
six month after writing it (ie after you forgotten 
everything but needs to fix something)

```

IÂ´m using [Visual C++ 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).
The solution will be numereded and divided into important computer subject:
Be Welcome to my website, where I explore Arduino, PIC & Rpi - [Jungletronics & KidTronics](https://medium.com/@J.3). 
I'm J3, The Arduino Hobbyist! and I will be your host :blush:    
Welcome!!!
