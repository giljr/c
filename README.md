# C Language
Styding c language

Hi, This is all about C. :raising_hand:

Why C?

C and C++ are among the most powerful languages you can find. Those are quite fast and stable, and thus are a good choice for microcontrollers. The compiler used to transform code into object files is avr-g++. Then, a program called avrdude is used to upload the program into the Arduino microcontroller.

During my Computer Engineering Degrees I will make this repo as As I learn more and more each day...
I thought I'd document what worked for me.
This is just for hobbyist fun. I did not expect anything more at a price of less than a cup of coffee :coffee:.

The most important audience for your code is yourself,

everything but needs to fix something) :smirk:

The solution will be numereded and divided into subject:
