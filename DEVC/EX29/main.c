   Format specifiers in C
   
   printf(char *format, arg1, arg2, â€¦)
   
   1 - Character format specifier : 	   %c
   2 - Integer format specifier   : 	   %d, %i
   3-  Floating-point format specifier :   %f, %e or %E
   4 - Unsigned Octal number for integer : %o
   5 - Unsigned Hexadecimal for integer :  %x, %X
   6 - String printing : 	           %s
   7 - Double floating-point number :      %lf
   
   
*****************************************************************************************
Output:

('A')             is a char  and as format specifier use %c  that results: A
(int x = 45)      is a int   and as format specifier use %d  that results: 45 or
(int y = 90)      is a int   and as format specifier use %i  that results: 45
(float a = 12.67) is a float and as format specifier use %f  that results: 12.670000 or
(float b = 17.69) is a float and as format specifier use %e  that results: 1.267000e+001
(int b = 9) is int to octal  and as format specifier use %o  that results: 10
(int c = 10) is a int to hex and as format specifier use %x  that results:  a
(char d[] = "j3") is string  and as format specifier use %s  that results: j3
(double e = 45.65) is double and as format specifier use %lf that results: 45.650000
